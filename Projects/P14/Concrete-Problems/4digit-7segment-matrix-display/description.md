### **Concrete Problem Statement**

Develop a microcontroller program for controlling a **4-digit 7-segment matrix display** (4x8) connected to two I/O ports. The display should:

1. **Display Logic**:
    - Display one of the predefined 4-digit numbers.
    - Support common anode (CA) or common cathode (CC) configuration.
    - Implement multiplexing using:
        - Time delays or interrupts.
2. **Input Selection**:
    - Use DIP switches to select the number to display.
    - Support multiple input modes:
        - **Single Switch Selection**: One number displayed; off state blanks the display.
        - **Dual Switch Selection**: Two numbers toggled based on switch state.
        - **1-8 Switch Selection**: Select one number from eight; blank if none selected.
        - Behavior when multiple numbers are selected simultaneously:
            - Specify behavior: Display first, last, or cycle through numbers every second.
    - Special modes:
        - Blink the first selected number at 4 Hz.
3. **Ports**:
    - Connect the **rows** (digit selection) to one port (e.g., `P2`).
    - Connect the **columns** (segment selection) to another port (e.g., `P3`).
