# Task Specification: Time Delay Generation Based on Timer Interrupts

## P7 - Generating Time Delays Based on the Interrupts of the Microcontroller's Timers

### Requirements:

1. **Clock Frequency:**
   - If the clock frequency is not specified, it will be assumed to be **12 MHz**.
   - If the frequency is specified, it should be used as is. If required, it must be calculated to meet the requirements based on the requested type of timer.

2. **Time Tolerance:**
   - The time tolerance achieved should be less than **+/-1%**.

3. **Functional Cycle of Timer:**
   - The time delay achieved with one functional cycle of the timer.
   
4. **Full Cycle of Timer:**
   - The time delay achieved with a full count of the timer's basic functional cycles.

5. **Basic Time and Number of Cycles:**
   - The basic time and number of cycles are given.
   
6. **Basic Time and Number of Cycles Calculation:**
   - The basic time and the number of cycles must be determined to achieve the required time delay.
