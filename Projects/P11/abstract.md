# Problem 11 - Reading the Pressed Key from a Matrix-Organized Keyboard and Displaying the Pressed State

## Problem Statement

The task involves reading the key pressed on a matrix-organized keyboard and displaying its pressed state. The locations where the functional units are connected can be provided or chosen from the available resources of the microcontroller. If no key is pressed, the indicator should be off. If two or more keys are pressed simultaneously, a minus sign should be displayed.

### Requirements:
1. **BCD Keyboard (4x3)**
2. **HEX Keyboard (4x4)**
3. **LED Display** (use as many as needed) where the logical high level (H) of the bit is indicated by a lit LED. The logical level at which the LED turns on can be provided or chosen as desired.
4. **7-Segment Display with BCD/HEX Input**
5. **7-Segment Display with Input for Each Segment**
6. **7-Segment Display with Common Cathode (CC)**
7. **7-Segment Display with Common Anode (CA)**
8. **7-Segment Display with CC or CA, as desired**

### Additional Notes:
- If no key is pressed, the indicator should be off.
- If two or more keys are pressed simultaneously, a minus sign should be displayed.
- The logical level for turning on the LED can be chosen as per preference.
- The type of 7-segment display (CC or CA) can be selected based on preference.
