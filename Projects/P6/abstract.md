# Task Specification: Accurate Time Delay Generation Without Interrupts

## P6 - Generating Time Delays Precisely as Required, Without Using Interrupts

### Requirements:

1. **Time Delay Generation:**
   - The time delay should be generated accurately as specified, without using interrupts.
   
2. **Clock Frequency Selection:**
   - The clock frequency should be selected in a way that allows the requested delay to be achieved.

3. **Accuracy of the Delay:**
   - If the clock frequency is provided, it should be specified that the delay can be achieved with the required accuracy.
   
4. **Generation of the Nearest Possible Time:**
   - If the exact requested delay cannot be generated, the closest possible time that is greater than or equal to the required delay should be generated.
