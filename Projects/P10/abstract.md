# P10 - Reading Key Press from Simple Keyboard and Displaying State

### **Description:**

Implement a system to read key presses from a simple keyboard (1 key per input) and display the pressed key's state. The location for the functional units can either be predefined or selected from the available microcontroller resources. If no key is pressed, the indicator will be off. If two or more keys are pressed simultaneously, a minus sign will be displayed.

- **BCD Keyboard**.
- **HEX Keyboard**.
- **LED Display**: Use as many LEDs as necessary so that the logic level H of the corresponding bit is displayed with the LED on. The logic level with which the LED turns on can either be specified or chosen as desired.
- **7-Segment Display**:
    - Display with BCD/HEX input.
    - Display with input for each segment.
    - Common Cathode (CC) 7-segment display.
    - Common Anode (CA) 7-segment display.
    - Use either CC or CA display as required.
