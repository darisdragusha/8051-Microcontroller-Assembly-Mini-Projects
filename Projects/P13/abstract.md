# Problem 13 - Expanding the Number of Inputs Using a Parallel-In Serial-Out Shift Register (Integrated Circuit 74HC165)

## Problem Statement

The task involves expanding the number of inputs using a parallel-in serial-out shift register (IC 74HC165). The expanded inputs are provided using switches or DIP switches. For testing, the state of the expanded inputs will be transferred to a specified or freely chosen microcontroller port for display of the specified type.

### Requirements:
1. **LED Display** (use as many as needed) where the logical high level (H) of the bit is indicated by a lit LED. The logical level at which the LED turns on can be provided or chosen as desired.
2. **7-Segment Display with BCD/HEX Input**
3. **7-Segment Display with Input for Each Segment**
4. **7-Segment Display with Common Cathode (CC)**
5. **7-Segment Display with Common Anode (CA)**
6. **7-Segment Display with CC or CA, as desired**

### Additional Notes:
- The shift register used is the **74HC165 IC**, which is a parallel-in serial-out shift register.
- The expanded inputs are provided using switches or DIP switches.
- The state of the expanded inputs is transferred to a microcontroller port (specified or freely chosen) for display.
- The display can be implemented using LEDs or 7-segment displays.
- The logical level for turning on the LED can be chosen as per preference.
- The type of 7-segment display (CC or CA) can be selected based on preference.
