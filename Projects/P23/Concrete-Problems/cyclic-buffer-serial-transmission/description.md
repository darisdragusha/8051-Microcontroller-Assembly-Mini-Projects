2. **election:**
    - Input ports or DIP switches determine which predefined string to transmit.
    - Input states are used to select one of the predefined strings.
3. **Indicators:**
    - **LEDs:** Indicate the state of the transmission buffer.
        - LEDs light up based on the current character being sent.
    - **7-Segment Display:** Shows:
        - The ASCII value of the character being transmitted.
        - The remaining buffer size.
4. **Buffer Implementation:**
    - A circular buffer stores multiple characters.
    - The circular buffer is initialized with the selected string.
    - Data wraps around when the buffer reaches its end.
5. **Input Logic:**
    - Input ports interpret the state of DIP switches:
        - Closed DIP switch → Logical High (H).
        - Open DIP switch → Logical Low (L).
6. **Display Configurations:**
    - 7-segment displays use either Common Cathode (CC) or Common Anode (CA), as per user preference.
    - Displays can show characters via BCD/HEX or individual segment inputs.
