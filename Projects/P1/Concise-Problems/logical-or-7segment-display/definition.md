**Description:**

Design an assembly program to compute the logical OR of three inputs connected to P1.0, P1.1, and P1.2, and display the output (0 or 1) on a common-anode (CA) 7-segment display connected to P2.

- Logical **0** turns off all segments.
- Logical **1** lights up segment `b` (represents 1 in CA).
