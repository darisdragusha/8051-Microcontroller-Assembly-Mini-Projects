**Description:**

Design an assembly program for the 8051 microcontroller to compute the logical AND of three 1-bit inputs (from DIP switches) and display the output on an LED connected to a pin. The inputs are connected to pins P1.0, P1.1, and P1.2, and the output will be shown on P2.0.

- **Logical H (high)** is represented by a closed switch, meaning input = 1.
- **Logical L (low)** is represented by an open switch, meaning input = 0.
- The LED lights up (H level) when the AND operation result is 1.
