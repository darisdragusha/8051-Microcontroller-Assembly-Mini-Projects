### **Problem 1: Timer-Driven State Transitions with LEDs**

1. **States**: Define 4 states (`S0`, `S1`, `S2`, `S3`) that transition cyclically every 1 second.
2. **Display**: Show the state on 4 LEDs connected to `P1.0â€“P1.3`. LED ON = Logic High (`H`).
3. **Input**: No external inputs; transitions are timer-driven.
