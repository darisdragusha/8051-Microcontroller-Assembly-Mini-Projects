### **Concrete Problem Statement**

Develop a microcontroller program to control an **8x8 LED matrix** connected to two I/O ports. The display should:

1. **Display Logic**:
    - Show one of the predefined figures (patterns).
    - Implement **multiplexing** using:
        - Time delays or interrupts.
    - Use two ports for connections:
        - **Rows** connected to one port (e.g., `P2`).
        - **Columns** connected to another port (e.g., `P3`).
2. **Input Selection**:
    - Use DIP switches to select the figure to display.
    - Support multiple input modes:
        - **Single Switch Selection**: Display one figure; off state blanks the display.
        - **Dual Switch Selection**: Toggle between two figures based on the switch state.
        - **1-8 Switch Selection**: Select one figure from eight predefined figures.
            - Blank the display if no switches are selected.
            - Define behavior when multiple switches are selected (e.g., first, last, or cyclic display).
    - Special modes:
        - Blink the **first selected figure** at 4 Hz.
        - Cycle through selected figures every second.
