# Problem 12 - Expanding the Number of Outputs Using a Serial-In Parallel-Out Shift Register (Integrated Circuit 4094)

## Problem Statement

The task involves expanding the number of outputs using a serial-in parallel-out shift register (IC 4094). For testing purposes, the state of the outputs can either be provided or read from a microcontroller port. If the test inputs are from a port, they are provided using switches or DIP switches. The state of the shift register output will be of the specified type.

### Requirements:
1. **LED Display** (use as many as needed) where the logical high level (H) of the bit is indicated by a lit LED. The logical level at which the LED turns on can be provided or chosen as desired.
2. **7-Segment Display with BCD/HEX Input**
3. **7-Segment Display with Input for Each Segment**
4. **7-Segment Display with Common Cathode (CC)**
5. **7-Segment Display with Common Anode (CA)**
6. **7-Segment Display with CC or CA, as desired**

### Additional Notes:
- The shift register used is the **4094 IC**, which is a serial-in parallel-out shift register.
- For testing, the input states can be provided via switches or DIP switches connected to a microcontroller port.
- The output state of the shift register will be displayed using LEDs or 7-segment displays.
- The logical level for turning on the LED can be chosen as per preference.
- The type of 7-segment display (CC or CA) can be selected based on preference.
