### Problem Statement: Byte Reception via Serial Communication

Design a program for the 8051 microcontroller to:

1. Receive bytes via serial communication (`RX`).
2. End reception if no new byte is received within a specific timeout interval.
3. Display the **last received byte** and the **current byte count** on:
    - LEDs connected to a microcontroller port.
    - A 7-segment display (optional: BCD/HEX input, common cathode (CC), or common anode (CA)).
4. Input generation from DIP switches or an external terminal.

### Requirements

- **Serial Communication**: 9600 bps baud rate using Timer 1.
- **Clock Frequency**: 11.0592 MHz.
- **Timeout Interval**: Configurable via Timer 0 in Mode 1 (16-bit).
- **Input Sources**: DIP switches or terminal.
- **Display Options**:
    - **LEDs**: Display the current byte count and the bits of the last received byte.
    - **7-Segment Display**: Show the count or ASCII value of the last received byte.
